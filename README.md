Basic MVP done for the project

### To run this project locally:

### User flow:

- On page rendered, it will show the current date and time. User have to select the location for the weather forecast and traffic cam data to show
- If the user change date and time, user have to reselect the locations for the weather forecast and traffic cam data to show
- After selection of any location, user is able to select other locations to view the data

### Enhancement:
